 Project Overview :-
This project focuses on classifying tweets based on whether they are related to a real disaster or not.
Given the text of a tweet, we aim to predict whether it refers to an actual emergency event (like a flood, earthquake, wildfire) or is just general chatter.
Tools and Technologies
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

Natural Language Processing (NLP):-
Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stopwords Removal)
TF-IDF Vectorization
Word Embeddings (optional: Word2Vec, GloVe)

Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Deep Learning (optional):
LSTM / GRU Neural Networks (using TensorFlow or PyTorch)

Deployment:
Streamlit or Flask Web App

. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-
Understand text lengths, missing values (keywords and locations).
Visualize frequent words in disaster vs non-disaster tweets (wordclouds).
Check class balance.

2. Text Preprocessing:-
Lowercasing
Removing punctuations, URLs, mentions, hashtags (optional: preserve hashtags)
Removing stopwords
Tokenization
Stemming or Lemmatization

Feature Engineering:-
TF-IDF vectorization
Adding additional features like keyword presence, tweet length, etc.

Model Building:-
Split data into train and test sets.
Train multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
Evaluate models using:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-score
ROC-AUC

Deep Learning Approach (optional):-
Convert text to sequences (word embeddings).
Train an LSTM/GRU network to capture sequential patterns.

6. Web App Deployment (optional):-
Create a simple interface for users to input a tweet and get a real-time prediction.
Host the app using Heroku, Streamlit Sharing, etc.
